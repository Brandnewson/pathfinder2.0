<h1>Pathfinder Visualiser 2.0</h1>

<h2> :sparkles:Ambition: </h2>
After creating my first generation of A-star pathfinder visualiser using Pygame. I became more ambitious and decided to expand my reach to the following:

- ReactJS
- Djiksta's algorithm
- Front-end Web Development

<h2> :pencil:Method: </h2>

Utilised ReactJS to create the brains of my project, here I further built on my knowledge from my Business Analyser Web App for website development, exposing myself to both ReactJS and Flask in the process. 

Features:

- Set point A
- Set point B
- Set up "walls" for the algorithm to figure its way around
- Execute the A-star algorithm
- Execute the Djiksta's algorithm
- Clearing of board for multiple usages
- CSS to showcase the execution of algorithm
