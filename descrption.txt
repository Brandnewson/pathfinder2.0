Pathfinder algorithms are the coolest things around, 
how does google maps determine how to bring you from Orchard to Tampines?
Through algorithms such as Astar or djikstra
In short, these are algorithms to find out, what is the 
shortest path between two destinations or nodes.

I created a pathfinder algorithm visualizer 
using javascript and css and the react library.

Firstly a grid was created, and then your start and 
finish node.
[Technical]
The djikstra algorithm finds the nearets unvisited node 
with the lowest distance, 
calculates the distance through it 
to each unvisited neighbour of that respective node
and updates the neighbour's distance if smaller.

It keeps repeating moving to the next node until it 
figures out what is 
the shortest path to get to your destination.

Effectively, finding out the shortest path from one node
to every other node.

[Simple]
In other words, it goes through every node surronding your
start node, and the nodes surrounding that, until it 
hits your finish node, by then it'll have the shortest
possible path between your start and finish

The Astar algorithm works by utilising the 
manhattan distance, it moves towards the finish node
because it guesses how close the finish node with
the manhattan distance, and as a result, can get to the 
destination faster than the djikstra algorithm

I feel like this project brought me a better
understanding of javascript, algorithms and how to 
visualise them.
